If you need to change either the URL or Hangers you will need to change them in multiple seperate files
-audit.js
-table.js
-addDelete.js

the variables are at the top of the files in lines 2 and 3 and have comments labeling them

Before you blame me
This was done like this because of massive technical issues with consolodating either
    - the entirety of the .js files or
    - the variables into one file and importing them into the others
